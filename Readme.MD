# First steps

1. Run `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
2. Start the server up with `nodemon index.js`

# Goals.

- You will create a working server that will allow a user to send data to a restaurant array and manipulate that array.

- // Route to add a new restaurant
- // Route to update an existing restaurant
- // Route to delete a restaurant
- // Route to get all restaurants

- Do not change any of the code that is already written, you will add the code under the //routes go here comment.
